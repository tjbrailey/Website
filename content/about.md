title: About Me
---

My name is Thomas (he/him) and I am an PhD student in Politics at the University of Oxford. I received my MPhil in Comparative Government (with distinction) from the University of Oxford in 2024. I received a Bachelor of Science in political science and data analytics (summa cum laude) from UC San Diego in 2020.

From 2020 to 2022, I served as a pre-doctoral fellow with J-PAL's [Payments and Governance Research Program](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/pgrp/home?authuser=0). I have also served as a research assistant for the Center for the Study of African Political Economy and as a lab assistant for the [Center for Peace and Security Studies](https://cpass.ucsd.edu/). 

I am broadly interested in three strands of political science: 

- Non-state (and private) actors and the provision of security. 
- State capacity and state-building. 
- Meta-science and replication.

My name is Thomas (he/him) and I am an PhD student in Politics at the University of Oxford.

In 2024, I received my MPhil in Comparative Government from the University of Oxford. My thesis was titled "Conceptualising Non-State Security".

From 2020 to 2022, I served as a pre-doctoral fellow with J-PAL's [Payments and Governance Research Program](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/pgrp/home?authuser=0). I received a Bachelor of Science in political science and data analytics from UC San Diego in 2020. 

I have also served as a research assistant for the Center for the Study of African Political Economy and as a lab assistant for the [Center for Peace and Security Studies](https://cpass.ucsd.edu/). 

My CV can be found [here](/tb.pdf).

I am broadly interested in three strands of political science: 

- Non-state (and private) actors and the provision of security. 

- State capacity and state-building. 

- Meta-science and replication.

Hello! 

My name is Thomas and I am a fourth year Political Science: Data Analytics major at UC San Diego. 

I am also a research assistant at the Center for the Study of African Political Economy and a lab assistant the [Center for Peace and Security Studies](https://cpass.ucsd.edu/).

I am interested in political institutions, elections, secession, and conflict in developing democracies, with a particular focus in sub-Saharan Africa.

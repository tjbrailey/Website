Hello! 

My name is Thomas and I am an MPhil student in Comparative Government at the University of Oxford.

From 2020 to 2022, I served as a pre-doctoral fellow with J-PAL's [Payments and Governance Research Program](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/pgrp/home?authuser=0). I received a Bachelor of Science in political science and data analytics from UC San Diego in 2020. 

I have also served as a research assistant for the Center for the Study of African Political Economy and as a lab assistant for the [Center for Peace and Security Studies](https://cpass.ucsd.edu/).

I am broadly interested in political institutions and how they account for minorities and diasporic populations. 

My CV can be found [here](/tb.pdf).

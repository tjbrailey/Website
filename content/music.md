# What I'm listening to
**The Physics House Band**: Incident on 3rd: Brighton-based experimental rock outfit evoke the thrills and anxieties of roaming a big city at night. 

**Laura Mvula**: Pink Noise: I love the 80's aesthetic of Mvula's new record---it manages to balance homage and authenticity with ease.

**Allan Holdsworth**: Live in Japan 1984: The much-missed fusion virtuoso and his band, I.O.U., melt faces in one of my favorite live performances of any band ever.

**Flowered Up**: A Life with Brian & Weekender: Savagely underrated London rock quartet Flowered Up brought Madchester down to London with a punchy debut (A Life with Brian) and epic swansong single Weekender (the accompanying short film directed by W.I.Z. is also a must-watch).  

**Dinner Party**: Dinner Party: Some of the hottest names in jazz/RnB conform to create a relaxed, minimalist, and highly enjoyable, if a little brief, album.   

**Haru Nemuri**: harutosyura: J-rock artist Haru Nemuri is exhilarating---catchy vocal lines, blistering guitar work, and very well-paced. 

**Stargazer**: Perihelion: 8-bit synths, quintuplet swings, and constant polyrhythms, Stargazer's second album is a marked improvement over their first outing and a really fun listen.

**JPEGMAFIA**: Veteran: Aggressive and progressive, Peggy's second full length is a overwhelming but highly addictive adventure.

**Jean-Luc Ponty**: Cosmic Messenger: 70's prog rock and electric violin is a surprising but wonderful pairing.

**Hugh Masekela**: Pure Sounds of Africa: A collection of Masekela's greatest tunes---Don't Go Lose It is an absolute jam that is way ahead of it's time---that are sure to lift your spirits.

**Three Trapped Tigers**: Numbers: 1-13: Cinematic instrumental math rock that really stands out from the pack; 5 and 6 are particular highlights for me. 

# My own music
In addition to doing political science research and data analysis and such, I like to write and record music. I'm currently recording through an Axe-Fx II, Focusrite Scarlett 2i2, and Cubase 10. I write music for [The Water Chestnuts](https://thewaterchestnuts.bandcamp.com/).

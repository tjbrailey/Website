      <description>For the past few months, I have been working as a research assistant for Professors Gareth Nellis and Jasper Cooper. The project focuses on Papua New Guineaâ€™s shift from first-past-the-post to the alternative vote in 2007. One outcome measure we are interested in is electoral-related violence, and whether incidents of violence increased or decreased following the implementation of the alternative vote.
Data on violence in PNG is sparse, and so I was tasked with creating a dataset of all election-related violent incidents around the 2002 and 2007 election periods.</description>

      <description>It is done! After two busy quarters, a suprisingly grueling winter break, and a frantic spring break, I have finished my senior thesis. The guidance and support from Professor Nellis, the seminar leaders, and the numerous graduate students I have interacted with, have helped to make my thesis a document that I am genuinely proud of. This experience has also made me a far better scholar and researcher, and I strongly encourage anyone who has the opportunity to undertake such a project to do so.</description>

      <description>Thesis progress is slow but rewarding. I have a skeleton of my thesis and am working dilligently to fill out the rest of it. One thing that I have to show is my power-sharing ontology. It’s a jargon-y word, I know, but it’s a fun concept to implement in R.
OntologyOntology is just a fancy word for family-tree. An ontology helps to visualize the relationship between upper-nodes and lower-nodes; parents and children.</description>

      <description>I was fortunate enough to have been invited into the political science honors program at UC San Diego. As part of the program, I am required to write a thesis on a topic of my choosing. The program consists of a weekly three-hour seminar, plus regular meeting with an advisor, and I will have two quarters to complete the paper.
I am incredibly lucky to have Professors Kaare Strom and Daniel Butler leading the seminar, and Professor Gareth Nellis as my thesis advisor.</description>

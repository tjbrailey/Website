      <description>I was fortunate enough to have been invited into the political science honors program at UC San Diego. As part of the program, I am required to write a thesis on a topic of my choosing. The program consists of a weekly three-hour seminar, plus regular meeting with an advisor, and I will have two quarters to complete the paper.
I am incredibly lucky to have Professors Kaare Strom and Daniel Butler leading the seminar, and Professor Gareth Nellis as my thesis advisor.</description>

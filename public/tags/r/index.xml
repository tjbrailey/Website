      <description>For the past few months, I have been working as a research assistant for Professors Gareth Nellis and Jasper Cooper. The project focuses on Papua New Guinea’s shift from first-past-the-post to the alternative vote in 2007. One outcome measure we are interested in is electoral-related violence, and whether incidents of violence increased or decreased following the implementation of the alternative vote.
Data on violence in PNG is sparse, and so I was tasked with creating a dataset of all election-related violent incidents around the 2002 and 2007 election periods.</description>

      <description>What is Electoral Proximity?Electoral proximity is the measure of fractionalization between a presidential and legislative election. That is, how temporally separated a state’s legislative and presidential elections might be. If presidential and legislative elections occur on the same day, they are considered to be proximally maximal. If there is a considerable gap between elections, then there is considered to be less proximity between elections. Gary Cox termed this phrase in Making Votes Count (1997) and builds off of the work of Matthew Shugart, John Carey, Rein Taagepera, and others.</description>

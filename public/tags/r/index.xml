      <description>Birds / SurfersEarlier this month, one of my favorite guitarists, Plini, made an Instagram post describing how a photograph of surfers out on the seas resembled notes on a staff, inspiring him to create a short piece of music. You can view the post and listen to an excerpt of his song “Surfers” here. Plini followed the same melody-generating process using an image of a flock of birds which is equally awesome.</description>

      <description>What is Electoral Proximity?Electoral proximity is the measure of fractionalization between a presidential and legislative election. That is, how temporally separated a state’s legislative and presidential elections might be. If presidential and legislative elections occur on the same day, they are considered to be proximally maximal. If there is a considerable gap between elections, then there is considered to be less proximity between elections. Gary Cox termed this phrase in Making Votes Count (1997) and builds off of the work of Matthew Shugart, John Carey, Rein Taagepera, and others.</description>

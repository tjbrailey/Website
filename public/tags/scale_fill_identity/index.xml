      <description>Hello and welcome to the first episode in a series I like to call “Ridiculously Niche Plots”! An intermittent series where I give a brief rundown of especially strange plots that I have spent hours trying to crack, in the hope that someone, somewhere, struggling to understand the ins and outs of gridExtra or who are hitting their head against a wall because ggplot2 is throwing out a horrifically labyrinthine error, might stumble on this article and have all of their questions answered.</description>

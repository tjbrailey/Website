      <description>In June 2020, I finished up my research assistant positions at UC San Diego’s (UCSD) political science department, and in July, I began working as a research associate for J-PAL’s Payments and Governance Research Program (PGRP), also at UCSD. Now I have been working there for about a month, I wanted to ruminate about the transition from RA to RA.
Me, being my naive and excitable self, dove head first into PGRP, assuming it to be a full-time version of the work I had been doing for the political science department.</description>

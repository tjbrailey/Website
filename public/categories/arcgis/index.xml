      <description>Hello and welcome to the second episode of Ridiculously Niche Plots! Today, we are moving away from R into the realm of ArcGIS. Arc is quite a bit different to R, and reproducing outputs can be a little complicated. While there is no code to show per se, I will run through the model which is laid out in a sort of flowchart format.
ContextThis project was part of my work at cPASS, specifically, Andres Gannonâ€™s dissertation on military specialization.</description>

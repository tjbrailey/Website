<p>It is done! After two busy quarters, a suprisingly grueling winter break, and a frantic spring break, I have finished my senior thesis. The guidance and support from Professor Nellis, the seminar leaders, and the numerous graduate students I have interacted with, have helped to make my thesis a document that I am genuinely proud of. This experience has also made me a far better scholar and researcher, and I strongly encourage anyone who has the opportunity to undertake such a project to do so. Regardless of your background, intrests, or career trajectories, this experience will vastly improve your analytical and time-management skills, and countless other aspects of your professional self.</p>
<p>My elevator pitch for my project: Disaggregated approaches to broad and disparate concepts like power-sharing allow for cumulative findings and a more fine-grain understanding of how the various components operate. In studying segmental autonomy, a component of multiple conceptions of power-sharing, power-dividing, parition, and ethnofederalism, I find mixed evidence of its effectiveness. While it seems to lead to democratic transitions, segmental autonomy has a limited effect on levels of social trust and conflict prolongation. What is important is this new framework by which we can better understand the substantive effects of the provisions of power-sharing, and, within this framework, our ability to generate cumulative findings in future studies.</p>
<p>The manuscript can be found <a href="https://github.com/tjbrailey/SeniorThesis/blob/master/paper/psp.pdf">here</a> and a replication package for all of the statistical models, plots, and figures, can be found <a href="https://github.com/tjbrailey/SeniorThesis">here</a>.</p>
<div id="unsolicited-advice" class="section level1">
<h1>Unsolicited Advice</h1>
<p>It’s interesting; everyone says the same thing about senior theses and other large-scale research projects, and everyone seems to fall into the same traps. So here are my hot takes on how to feel good about your thesis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start early. I started contacting and drafting ideas with Professor Nellis over the summer, so I went into the quarter with a research proposal and a really solid timeline for the project. It also meant that I was never stressed about coming up with ideas, and I had a bunch of leeway when I needed to re-run models and re-jig my plots and whatnot.</p></li>
<li><p>A corollary: little chunks at a time. It’s all well-and-good starting early, but if you stop and leave everything till the end, you undo all your hard work. Set weekly and monthly goals, meet regularly with your advisors and those whom you work well with and have them hold you accountable, and steadily plod your way through the project. Everything stays fresh in your mind, and the project ceases to be this overwhelming beast of esoteric stuff, and starts to look more like a regular class.</p></li>
<li><p>Write about something you’re genuinely interested in/perpelexed by/passionate about. I started by drafting ideas that I thought would sound cool or get me extra points when getting the thesis graded, but this was a massive waste of time. I was really interested in power-sharing and the whole “cumulative learning” thing that I read about in Metaketa I. And when I set my mind on this, the whole process became markedly easier, more exciting, and more fun.</p></li>
<li><p>Go big, but not too big. I, in my undergraduate excitement, really wanted to tackle all of the components of power-sharing in a grandiose, machine-learning-driven, discipline-shattering—nay, earth-shattering—project. But I quickly realized that this was probably a little unrealistic. Good papers are those that tackle big ideas using focused and concise designs. I settled on just studying segmental autonomy, supplementing a cross-sectional study with a couple of very focused case studies. This made for a much better paper than if I were to tackle all the provisions of power-sharing in a superficial manner.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few tidbits for any student who happens upon this page, and hope they are of some use. Thanks for reading!</p>

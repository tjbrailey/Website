      <description>Hello and welcome to the first episode in a series I like to call “Ridiculously Niche Plots”! An intermittent series where I give a brief rundown of especially strange plots that I have spent hours trying to crack, in the hope that someone, somewhere, struggling to understand the ins and outs of gridExtra or who are hitting their head against a wall because ggplot2 is throwing out a horrifically labyrinthine error, might stumble on this article and have all of their questions answered.</description>

      <title>Electoral Violence in Papua New Guinea </title>

      <description>For the past few months, I have been working as a research assistant for Professors Gareth Nellis and Jasper Cooper. The project focuses on Papua New Guinea’s shift from first-past-the-post to the alternative vote in 2007. One outcome measure we are interested in is electoral-related violence, and whether incidents of violence increased or decreased following the implementation of the alternative vote.
Data on violence in PNG is sparse, and so I was tasked with creating a dataset of all election-related violent incidents around the 2002 and 2007 election periods.</description>

      <description>Birds / SurfersEarlier this month, one of my favorite guitarists, Plini, made an Instagram post describing how a photograph of surfers out on the seas resembled notes on a staff, inspiring him to create a short piece of music. You can view the post and listen to an excerpt of his song “Surfers” here. Plini followed the same melody-generating process using an image of a flock of birds which is equally awesome.</description>

      <title>Calculating Electoral Proximity in R</title>

      <description>What is Electoral Proximity?Electoral proximity is the measure of fractionalization between a presidential and legislative election. That is, how temporally separated a state’s legislative and presidential elections might be. If presidential and legislative elections occur on the same day, they are considered to be proximally maximal. If there is a considerable gap between elections, then there is considered to be less proximity between elections. Gary Cox termed this phrase in Making Votes Count (1997) and builds off of the work of Matthew Shugart, John Carey, Rein Taagepera, and others.</description>

      <description>It is done! After two busy quarters, a suprisingly grueling winter break, and a frantic spring break, I have finished my senior thesis. The guidance and support from Professor Nellis, the seminar leaders, and the numerous graduate students I have interacted with, have helped to make my thesis a document that I am genuinely proud of. This experience has also made me a far better scholar and researcher, and I strongly encourage anyone who has the opportunity to undertake such a project to do so.</description>

      <title>Senior Thesis: Ontology</title>

      <description>Thesis progress is slow but rewarding. I have a skeleton of my thesis and am working dilligently to fill out the rest of it. One thing that I have to show is my power-sharing ontology. It’s a jargon-y word, I know, but it’s a fun concept to implement in R.
OntologyOntology is just a fancy word for family-tree. An ontology helps to visualize the relationship between upper-nodes and lower-nodes; parents and children.</description>

      <description>I was fortunate enough to have been invited into the political science honors program at UC San Diego. As part of the program, I am required to write a thesis on a topic of my choosing. The program consists of a weekly three-hour seminar, plus regular meeting with an advisor, and I will have two quarters to complete the paper.
I am incredibly lucky to have Professors Kaare Strom and Daniel Butler leading the seminar, and Professor Gareth Nellis as my thesis advisor.</description>
